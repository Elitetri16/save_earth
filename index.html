      <h1>World Environment Day</h1>
      <h2></h2>
      <p>The Environment is one of the most important tools for our survival on planet Earth. 
        The Environment nurtures us and helps us survive. We cannot imagine life without air,
         water and soil. The biotic components like plants and animals are also important survival tools. Plants help purify the air around us. We get food from plants and animals.</p>
        <p>All the components of the Environment are dependent on each other in a web of relations known as the ecological web. It is necessary to maintain this web in balance because if one component collapses then the entire web will crumble destroying all life forms. This is why we must choose to work towards preserving the Environment and undoing the damage we did.</p>
